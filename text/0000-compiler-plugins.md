# Summary

Fusion plugins should be able to perform operations at build-time.

# Basic example

```js
// src/app.js

import {foo} from "fusion-plugin-foo";

foo();
```

```json
{
  "name": "fusion-plugin-foo",
  "...": "...",
  "fusion": {
    "compiler-plugin": "./compiler-plugin.js"
  }
}
```

```js
// node_modules/fusion-plugin-foo/compiler-plugin.js
module.exports = function plugin() {
  return {
    analyzer: (...babelPluginArgs) => {
      // Traverse AST to count number of times `foo` is invoked
      return {callCount};
    },
    transformer: (...babelPluginArgs) => {
      // Conceptually equivalent to "babel-macros" idea
      // Statically replace `foo()` CallExpression with "foo" StringLiteral
    },
    aggregator: (allMetadata, compiler) => {
      let count = 0;
      for (let [filename, metadata] of allMetadata.entries()) {
        if (metadata.callCount) {
          count += metadata.callCount;
        }
      }

      const codeForServerEntry = `
        console.log("foo() was invoked ${callCount} times");
        `;

      return {server: codeForServerEntry};
    },
  };
};
```

# Motivation

Many fusion plugins rely on static analysis, buildtime transformations, and code generation including:

- `fusion-plugin-i18n`
- `fusion-react-async`
- Future plugins such as experimentation

However, the build-time functionality is currently implemented in `fusion-cli` which is far from ideal.

# Detailed design

## High-level compiler phases

1. Analysis
   - Only analysis/metadata extraction, no modification of AST
2. Macros
   - Macros on source code, (e.g. JSX to JSX macros)
4. ECMAScriptification
   - Transforms user source code into standard ECMAScript that can be parsed by webpack (e.g. JSX/Flow transforms)
5. Bundling
   - Webpack
   - Code generation
7. Optimization (optional)
   - ES2018 to ES5 transpilation *after* bundling
   - Minification
   - Browser-specific transpilation and minification in the future

## Compiler plugins

Compiler plugins are composed of three high-level functions:

### Analyser

Returns serializable metadata given a file's AST. This must be serializable because this step might be cached. Run in analysis phase.

- Useful for i18n, etc.

### Transformer

Transforms a file's AST. Might be cached. This is equilavent to the idea of "babel macros". Run in macro phase.

### Aggregator

Consumes aggregated metadata. Returns JS source code to be injected into entry. Run in bundle phase.

## Implementation

### Webpack `babel-loader` equivalent

1. Parse file source into AST
2. Extract import statements from AST
3. Use webpack loader [`resolve` API](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#this-resolve) to find package.json metadata associated with imports
4. Collect plugins from "fusion-compiler-plugin" field from package.json metadata
5. Run plugins


Benefits of this strategy:
- No additional file I/O overhead, since imported dependencies need to be resolved by webpack anyways.
- No additional parse overhead, since these files must be parsed by Babel anyways.

### Post-bundling transpilation

ES2018 to ES5 transpilation will be performed after bundling.

# Drawbacks

**Exposing Babel as part of public API**

This might make migrating to a different compiler tools more difficult later.

**Theoretical worst-case 50% increase in parse overhead**

Currently source code is parsed once by Babel and once by Webpack. After this proposal, transpilation would be moved into a new phase after bundling (resulting in an extra parse). Ideally this is skipped entirely in development (e.g. development w/ Chrome) and bundle splitting means this can be partially cached, but the worst case can be slower in theory. In practice, persistent caching, incremental rebuilds, and development with evergreen browsers should make this not much of an issue. Also if the parse can be shared between Uglify and Babel, then there's no extra parse overhead provided minification is also performed in development.


# Alternatives

**`babel-plugin-macros`**

Macros alone are insufficient for many use cases; often some form of program-wide static analysis and code-generation is required.

# Adoption strategy

- The initial rollout can be a pure refactor with no code changes for Fusion.js users (only dependency upgrades)
- Worthwhile possible future explorations include:
  - Extracting this into a standalone Webpack plugin eventually
  - Merging with `babel-plugin-macros`
  - Collaborating with "single-parse" bundlers/compilers such as Parcel to support similar functionality out of the box

# How we teach this

The word "plugin" is already used a lot in Fusion, so perhaps different terminology might be better.

# Unresolved questions

- Should minification or transpilation happen first?
- What about browser or server-only transformers?
- Is it sufficient if transformers/analyzers only run on files that import the package containing the compiler plugin?
